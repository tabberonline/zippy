// React and ReactDOM are libraries that enable you to build user interfaces using React components and render them to the DOM.

// The line import './index.css'; imports a CSS file (index.css) that contains styles specific to this application.

// App is a component imported from the App.js file, which represents the main component of the application.

// The Provider component is imported from the 'react-redux' library and is used to provide the Redux store to the React components.

// The PersistGate component is imported from the 'redux-persist/integration/react' library and is used to persist and 
//rehydrate the Redux store.

// The store and persistor are imported from the './app/store' file. We'll explain the contents of this file separately.

// The ReactDOM.render() function is called to render the application. It takes two arguments:

// The JSX code within the parentheses, which represents the structure of the application.
// The document.getElementById('root') expression, which identifies the DOM element where the application will be rendered.
